    I hold a Master of Computer Science degree from Wardiere University, completed between 2029 and 2030. Prior to that, 
    I earned my Bachelor of Computer Engineering from the same institution, graduating in 2029 with a GPA of 3.8 out of 4.0. 
    These academic experiences gave me a solid foundation in software architecture, algorithms, and systems design.

      I specialize in full-stack web development, using modern technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, React, Next.js, and Vue on the frontend, 
      along with Python, Django, and Flask on the backend. My experience also includes working with RESTful APIs, GraphQL, Git, CI/CD pipelines, Docker containers, 
      and both SQL and NoSQL databases. I thrive in Agile and Scrum environments, and value clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

      <p>I’m a passionate Software Developer with a strong background in building scalable web applications and crafting efficient backend systems. I thrive in fast-paced environments and 
         love turning complex problems into elegant, maintainable code. With a deep interest in emerging technologies and continuous learning, I aim to create digital solutions that make a real impact.</p>

      Currently, I work at CodeCraft Labs as a Full-Stack Developer, where I’m responsible for building and maintaining robust web applications using technologies like React and Node.js.
      My role involves designing scalable architecture, developing APIs, and collaborating closely with designers and product teams to ensure optimal user experience.
      Before this, I was a Backend Developer at DevBridge Studio from 2025 to 2029. There, I focused on building scalable API services using Django and Express, handling backend logic, 
      enhancing security layers, and optimizing database performance. I also took an active role in code reviews and maintaining best practices across the development lifecycle.
      I began my professional journey at TechNest Solutions as a Junior Web Developer in 2024. During that time, I assisted in frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
      contributed to bug fixing efforts, and learned to work effectively within an Agile team setup.
