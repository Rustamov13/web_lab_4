      <h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Currently, I work at CodeCraft Labs as a Full-Stack Developer, where I’m responsible for building and maintaining robust web applications using technologies like React and Node.js.  
        My role involves designing scalable architecture, developing APIs, and collaborating closely with designers and product teams to ensure optimal user experience.  
        Before this, I was a Backend Developer at DevBridge Studio from 2025 to 2029. There, I focused on building scalable API services using Django and Express, handling backend logic,  
        enhancing security layers, and optimizing database performance. I also took an active role in code reviews and maintaining best practices across the development lifecycle.  
        I began my professional journey at TechNest Solutions as a Junior Web Developer in 2024. During that time, I assisted in frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,  
        contributed to bug fixing efforts, and learned to work effectively within an Agile team setup.</p>
